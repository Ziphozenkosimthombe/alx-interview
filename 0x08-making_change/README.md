# 0. Change comes from within

This project delves into the classic coin change problem, challenging you to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount. By applying your understanding of greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, you'll devise a solution that not only works but also excels in efficiency.

## Concepts Needed

* **Greedy Algorithms:**
    * Understand how greedy algorithms operate and why they're suitable for the coin change problem.
    * Recognize the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.
* **Dynamic Programming:**
    * Grasp the fundamental principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
    * Explore the concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.
* **Algorithmic Complexity:**
    * Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
    * Strive for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.
* **Problem-Solving Strategies:**
    * Break down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
    * Understand the differences between iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.
* **Python Programming:**
    * Manipulate lists and utilize list comprehensions effectively.
    * Implement functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
